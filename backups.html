    <p>This is a single page application that presents information about
    backing up the content of a space, public and private. It also provides
    links for doing a quick backup of <em>only</em> the latest revisions of
    all your tiddlers. If you need something more complex, hopefully some of
    the information provided here can guide you.</p>

<div class="warning" ng-show="space.isSelf">
    <p>Note: In order for the backup links to display, you must include the
    <strong>backups</strong> space in your space, via the <em>space control
    panel</em> found by visiting the blue and pink dot in the upper right
    when viewing your space.</p>
